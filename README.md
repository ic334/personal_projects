# Personal Projects 🚀 (a.k.a. My First GitHub Organizational Crisis)

Welcome to my **Personal Projects** repo—originally intended as a convenient storage space for my small coding experiments. However, I have since realized that cramming a bunch of unrelated projects into a single repo was... well, **not my best idea**.  

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned  
1. **Each project deserves its own repo.** Because future me shouldn’t have to dig through a folder labyrinth to find that one script I need.  
2. **Version control is not file hoarding.** Just because I can keep everything in one place doesn’t mean I should.  
3. **Good organization = less future suffering.**  

## 🛠 What’s in Here?  
A random assortment of mini-projects, scripts, and experiments, ranging from:  
✔️ Cool stuff I actually finished  
✔️ Half-baked ideas that might be brilliant… or cursed  
✔️ Debugging nightmares I’m too emotionally attached to delete  

## 🔮 The Future of This Repo  
Going forward, I’ll be **splitting** these projects into their own repos like a responsible coder. But for now, consider this an **archive of my past mistakes & learning experiences**.  

Enjoy the chaos. 😎
